GRaF provides functions to fit, visualise, and predict from Gaussian random field models for binary data, with an emphasis on species distribution models. The principle function is \code{\link{graf}} which returns a \code{graf} object, which can be manipulated using \code{plot}, \code{print} and \code{predict} methods among others.

GRaF is under active development and future releases will enable a range of additional methods, which may (or may not) include: models for count data, spatially and temporally explicit models, the ability to limit interactions between covariates, multi-species models and input and output of raster imagery. Please feel free to contact the maintainer with bug reports and suggestions!
