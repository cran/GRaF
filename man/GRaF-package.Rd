GRaF provides functions to fit, visualise, and predict from Gaussian random field models for binary data, with an emphasis on species distribution models. The principle function is \code{\link{graf}} which returns a \code{graf} object, which can be manipulated using \code{plot}, \code{print} and \code{predict} methods among others.

GRaF is under active development and future releases will enable a range of additional methods, which may (or may not) include: models for count data, spatially and temporally explicit models, the ability to limit interactions between covariates, multi-species models and input and output of raster imagery. Please feel free to contact the maintainer with bug reports and suggestions!

The development version of this package is hosted on github (\url{https://github.com/goldingn/GRaF}) and a brief tutorial is available here: \url{https://rawgithub.com/goldingn/intecol2013/master/tutorial/graf_workshop.html}
